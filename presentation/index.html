        <!-- Slide 3: Context API -->
        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>Context API</h2>
            <p>
              Context API is a feature provided by React that allows data to be
              passed through the component tree without the need to explicitly
              pass props down to every level. It helps solve the prop drilling
              problem, where data needs to be passed through multiple
              components, even if some intermediate components don't use that
              data.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Example usage of Context API:</p>
            <pre><code class="js" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers>
							const UserContext = React.createContext();
							&lt;UserContext.Provider value={userData}&gt;
							&lt;ComponentA /&gt;
							&lt;ComponentB /&gt;
							&lt;/UserContext.Provider&gt;
						</code>
						</pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Pros of using Context API:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simple to implement, especially for small to medium-sized apps.
              </li>
              <li>No need to install additional libraries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cons of using Context API:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not ideal for larger, more complex applications with deep
                nesting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Can lead to performance issues due to excessive re-renders.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Slide 4: Redux -->
        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>Redux</h2>
            <p>
              Redux is a popular state management library for React (and other
              JavaScript frameworks) that provides a predictable and centralized
              way to manage the state of an application. It follows a one-way
              data flow, which means that data in the application flows in a
              single direction, making state changes more predictable and easier
              to manage.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Example usage of Redux:</p>
            <pre><code class="js" data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers >
							const initialState = {
							count: 0,
							};
							
							function reducer(state = initialState, action) {

								switch (action.type) {
								case 'INCREMENT':
								return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };

								case 'DECREMENT':
								return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
								
								default:
								return state;
								}
							}
							
							const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

          <section>
            <p>Pros of using Redux:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Centralized global state management.</li>
              <li>
                Excellent for large and complex applications with predictable
                state changes.
              </li>
              <li>Time travel debugging and extensive tooling support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cons of using Redux:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Requires more boilerplate code compared to Context API.</li>
              <li>Steep learning curve, especially for beginners.</li>

            <p>When to choose Context API over Redux:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Context API is suitable for small to medium-sized applications
                with less nesting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Redux is preferable for large and complex applications with deep
                nesting and predictable state changes.

            <p>
              Example 1: Building a simple user profile page with limited data
              sharing - Context API can be a good choice here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example 2: Building an e-commerce application with multiple pages
              and complex data sharing - Redux is a better fit for this
              scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example 3: A medium-sized blog application with a moderate level
              of data sharing - Context API might be sufficient for this use
              case.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Context API and Redux are powerful tools for state management in
            React apps. Remember that the choice between Context API and Redux
            largely depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your
            project. Both solutions have their strengths and can greatly improve
            the state management of your React applications.
